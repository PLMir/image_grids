# image_grids
Use this python script to create grids of varying proportions for a pair of images. 
You can pass a list of item names and a list of proportions, for instance to generate stimuli for several items and several conditions for an experiment. 

The script currently assumes that images are in png format and that the naming scheme for each pair is of the form "item_A.png" and "item_B.png".
